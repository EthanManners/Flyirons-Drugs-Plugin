Flyiron’s Drugs is a [B]persistent drug, addiction, overdose, and withdrawal system[/B] designed first for [B]survival SMP servers[/B], and also works well in PvP/economy/factions environments.
It adds a long-term gameplay layer built around [B]risk, supply chains, tolerance, addiction, overdose, and recovery[/B], rather than short-lived novelty buffs.

This is not a "one-time gimmick" plugin. It's built for long-running worlds with economies, conflict, and supply chains.

[SIZE=5][B]What Your Players Get[/B][/SIZE]
[LIST]
[*]Persistent addiction mechanics
[*]Config-driven overdose risk and outcomes
[*]Resource-heavy drug production
[*]Meaningful tradeoffs between power and long-term consequences
[/LIST]

[B]Out of the box by design:[/B] the default configs are intentionally balanced relative to each other and are meant to be dropped into a live survival server with minimal setup.
You [I]can[/I] rebalance everything, but the default experience is already engineered to create stable gameplay loops.

[SIZE=5][B]Disclaimer[/B][/SIZE]
This plugin is a [B]fictional gameplay system[/B] created for use in Minecraft servers.

All items, names, effects, and mechanics included in this plugin are [B]entirely fictionalized and abstracted for gameplay purposes[/B]. They are not intended to represent real-world substances, encourage real-life behavior, or provide accurate information about drugs or their effects.

Any resemblance to real substances, terminology, or experiences is purely for [B]in-game thematic design[/B]. The mechanics are designed solely to create engaging risk/reward gameplay, resource management, and player-driven systems within a virtual environment.

This plugin is intended for [B]entertainment purposes only[/B] and should be used responsibly by server owners in accordance with platform rules and community guidelines.

[SIZE=5][B]Core Gameplay Systems[/B][/SIZE]
[SIZE=4][B]Drug Effects[/B][/SIZE]
Each drug provides [B]strong, situational benefits[/B] paired with drawbacks. Effects are intentionally short to medium duration and are not meant to replace vanilla potions.

Use cases include:

[LIST]
[*]PvP combat
[*]Mining and resource gathering
[*]Movement and mobility
[*]Team coordination and visibility
[*]Risk/reward decision making
[/LIST]

[SIZE=4][B]Addiction & Tolerance[/B][/SIZE]
Repeated use of drugs builds [B]tolerance[/B]. Once tolerance reaches a threshold, the player becomes [B]addicted[/B].

Key points:

[LIST]
[*]Addiction persists across deaths and logouts
[*]Addiction is [B]drug-specific[/B]
[*]High-risk drugs can cause addiction after very few uses
[*]Tolerance reduces effectiveness of repeated doses
[/LIST]

[SIZE=4][B]Overdose System[/B][/SIZE]
Using drugs too frequently or at high tolerance levels can result in an [B]overdose[/B].

Overdose mechanics:

[LIST]
[*]Are configurable per drug
[*]Scale with tolerance and recent usage
[*]Can result in severe effects or death
[*]Trigger custom death messages indicating the drug involved
[/LIST]

Overdose risk varies by drug:

[LIST]
[*]Some drugs are [B]non-lethal[/B]
[*]Others are intentionally unforgiving
[/LIST]

This keeps high-power strategies risky even for experienced players.

[SIZE=4][B]Withdrawal System[/B][/SIZE]
Once addicted, players suffer [B]persistent withdrawal effects[/B].

Withdrawal:

[LIST]
[*]Does [B]not expire automatically[/B]
[*]Persists until cured or temporarily blocked
[*]Varies by drug class
[/LIST]

To escape withdrawal, a player must either:

[LIST]
[*]Use the drug again (temporary relief), or
[*]Use the appropriate [B]cure item[/B]
[/LIST]

[SIZE=4][B]Cures & Recovery[/B][/SIZE]
Different addictions require different cures:

[LIST]
[*][B]Suboxone[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Cures opioid addiction (Heroin, Fent, and configured profiles)
[/LIST]
[*][B]CBD[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Cures weed addiction paths
[*]Weed withdrawal is hunger-based
[/LIST]
[*][B]Sleeping[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Cures configured stimulant addictions (including Meth)
[/LIST]
[*][B]Enchanted Golden Apple[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Universal cure path
[*]Removes addictions/withdrawals instantly
[/LIST]
[/LIST]

[SIZE=5][B]Game Design Dynamics (Why the Defaults Matter)[/B][/SIZE]
The balancing is engineered to shape [B]server behavior[/B], not just item effects.

[LIST]
[*][B]Survival SMPs (primary target):[/B] players form farms, trade routes, and cure supply chains; repeated users create demand pressure and territorial hotspots.
[*][B]Economy servers:[/B] consumables become sinks and profit drivers; cure scarcity and dangerous recipes create meaningful pricing and market cycles.
[*][B]PvP/Factions:[/B] short combat spikes are powerful, but addiction/tolerance punishes endless spam, creating timing-based fights and resource attrition.
[*][B]Long-running worlds:[/B] persistent consequences produce player stories (dependence, recovery, overdoses, black-market trading, logistics wars).
[/LIST]

In short, the plugin is designed so power has upkeep costs, and those upkeep costs create emergent social/economic outcomes.
